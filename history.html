            <p>Looking back over the past century of film, it is easily seen how much progress has been made in showcasing the female voice in film. However, there are still many more barriers to breakthrough and many more milestones to reach. In short, there is still much more progress to be made. It is not only enough to showcase some female's voices, but a diverse set of female voices.</p>
